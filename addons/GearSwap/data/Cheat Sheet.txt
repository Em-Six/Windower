Feel free to contact me OUTSIDE of the game though, and I'm happy to help.

Don't feel disparaged if you can't get it working with this alone a lot of people can't when they're first starting messing with these things.

My github ( https://github.com/Selindrile/GearSwap ) If you obtained this cheatsheet elsewhere this should have the up to date versions of most everything
	of mine, but also PLEASE DO NOT MESSAGE ME ABOUT ANYTHING THIRD PARTY IN GAME.

My Stream Discord, ( https://discord.gg/ug6xtvQ ) this is the best way to reach me, in the allchat channel or through DM,
	alternatively you can connect with me through a messenger (They're linked to my FFXIAH account.) If you're relatively computer savvy,
	it shouldn't be too hard, if not, I'm happy to help explain more or answer questions even if you do get it working.

Again PLEASE DO NOT MESSAGE ME ABOUT ANYTHING THIRD PARTY IN GAME, however feel free to shoot me a way to contact you outside of game, through
	the game, and I'm happy to help.

	
For full functionality my gearswap and init files do depend on a few other addons that can be found in your launcher, I'll list them here: 
	Addons: Shortcuts, Cancel, Itemizer.    Plugins: Timers, Run

To make use of other types of gearswap files along with mine, place them in the common folder, and make sure to
name them Character_Job.lua.

My scripts\init.txt loads Request, which is an addon that can be used to answer player's requests, use it with the Shortcuts addon.

--- Item Handling ---

Items are handled by the useitem command, witht he following syntax:
gs c useitem slot item name

For example:
windower.send_command('bind ^h gs c useitem ring2 Warp Ring')

As a Macro:
/console gs c useitem ring2 Warp Ring

[Control + Z] Capacity Mode
Will automatically use capacity items and keep capacity cape on, for this to work it
seems you must keep your capacity items in your inventory or satchel, not in any wardrobe locations.
In the wardrobe they seem to report the wrong times to the function that checks them, don't know why.

--- Auto Commands ---
Some of my job gearswaps have automatic functions, like auto-enmity for Pld, auto-buffing and auto nuking, often they are
windows +f8 or windows +Pause/Break - These can mostly be changed in Character-Globals.lua.

:Macro:		/console gs c toggle AutoNukeMode
:Macro:		/console gs c toggle AutoBuffMode
:Macro:		/console gs c toggle AutoTankMode
:Macro:		/console gs c toggle AutoReadyMode
:Macro:		/console gs c toggle AutoNukeMode
:Macro:		/console gs c toggle AutoSubMode

You may reset some of the choices for automatic modes with commands like the following.

//gs c autonuke fire5
//gs c autows Savage Blade
//gs c autows tp 1250
//gs c autofood Soy Ramen

Export Command for editing gearswap.

//gs export lua    OR    /console gs export lua

Creates a file in Gearswap\Data\Export with your current set detailed as a file, useful for
getting specific augments labelled just right in gearswap, either for putting job specific items
at the top of your job_gear lua or for all jobs in your items.lua.
