(Kastra) thanks a ton

(Kastra) i think thats literally 100% of the possible dINT ranges that SE programmed

(Kastra) unless you're right and it increases again at like 500+

(Kastra) which is unlikely, so i wont bother

(Sensarity) yeah

(Kastra) i'll hang on to all this INT+ gear for a few days just in case i need to redo something
