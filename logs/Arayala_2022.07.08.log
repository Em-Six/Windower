Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: Guys: Here's a hint that BGwiki isnt telling you about A.M.A.N BCNM.

Redwoods[Norg]: WTB * Mars/Venus orb 2.5M * Do you have it? Sell?

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: "Srota" means Wednesday in Polish. If you use your Mars & Venus orb on a Wednesday you might get the drop.

Slowmo[Rabao]: Odyssey C - 4 x Halo + NM Team up? /tell BRD or BigDogWAR/SAM @5/6

Mostlyawsm[PortJeuno]: you had me there for a sec

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: Spicyryan and his cohorts at bgwiki dont want you to know that. Good luck! <3

Bazing[Norg]: you have to face SW with 91% moon phase while having 7 rock salts in inventory too

Slowmo[Rabao]: Odyssey C - 4 x Halo + NM Team up? /tell BRD or BigDogWAR/SAM @5/6

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: No. Srota really does mean Wednesday. Use your orbs on a wednesday only like Redwoods does to get the gils.

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: Look it up in a Polish dictionary if you dont believe. i am half Polish myself ^^

Slowmo[Rabao]: Odyssey C - 4 x Halo + NM Team up? /tell BRD/BigDogWARorSAM @5/6

Bazing[Norg]: sroda means moron in Dutch

[2]<Eidos> ouch

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: Quiet you.

[2]<Eidos> complete mobo failure is bad luck

[2]<Relisaa> well I must have the best bad luck then. this is the second time the failsafe has failed across 2 different manufactu

[2]<Relisaa> though that mobo was over 5 years old

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: the the RMT know this; hence why the BCNM area is always packed on Wednesday.

[2]<Relisaa> this one was only 2.5 years old though.

Cholesterol[LowJeuno]: Don't trust BGwiki. They are out to withhold info from us. Info about Odyssey, Info about anything that makes gil.
