[1]<Kastra> i cant imagine a worse way to spend a single weekend

[1]<Gesetz> sounds like the words of someone who wants to fail at ffxi

[1]<Ornstien> Seems like a 10/10 weekend to me

[1]<Kastra> 0/10 would not recommend

[1]<Gesetz> there are like 2 useful mythics, so if you aren't making a carn or yag, may as well waste a mythic on vaj

[1]<Kastra> gastra, liberator, nirvana, DP, KKK(still?), and tizona are all worth it

[1]<Ornstien> Ges pls dont shit talk my DP / Gastra :(

[1]<Kastra> lmao

[1]<Gesetz> lib is only a fun toy. I say this as a lib drk

[1]<Gesetz> dp is one of the better dps mythics, sure

[1]<Gesetz> gastra is a dp, but for shitty rng

[1]<Ornstien> Those RNG buffs are kinda silly atm tho

[1]<Gesetz> tizona is the best weapon for blu, but blu is not what it used to be. I say this also as a tiz blu

[1]<Ornstien> Oh Ges how is your current Aeonic run going ?

[1]<Gesetz> vajra is useful in like 3 scenarios. that alone makes it worth wasting a mythic on

[1]<Kastra> thats the spirit

[1]<Gesetz> I got sick/busy and stopped after doing schah 

[1]<Ornstien> What you got left ?

[1]<Gesetz> all of the other ones minus worm

[1]<Ornstien> I have Albumen / Erinys / teles and Worm

[1]<Ornstien> Then i get to make a real fun toy after gonna do a trishula

[1]<Gesetz> I would prob make trish next too

[1]<Kastra> could use vini and albu to finish bow myself

[1]<Gesetz> or waste it on a lockstyle shield

[1]<Gesetz> we wiped to vini due to poor planning, but I went club drk to it

[1]<Ornstien> Yea for me its either Trish or Bow literally for arrows

[1]<Gesetz> 70k True Strikes
