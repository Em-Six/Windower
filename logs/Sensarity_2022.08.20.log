[1]<Aigulfe> they both in same room   and hes kinda a dick lol

[1]<Aigulfe> we killed him but it took a long time

[1]<Aigulfe> basically dispelled us to nothing

[1]<Sensarity> We kill all of section B before doing Leshonn and he's a joke
[1]<Sensarity> That's just what his wind mod e TP attacks do
[1]<Aigulfe> yeah  i kinda envisioned that being a thing

[1]<Sensarity> He absorbs your buffs 
[1]<Aigulfe> first time thru we had killed a good chunk

[1]<Sensarity> he does it even on full clear
[1]<Aigulfe> and he dropped fast

[1]<Aigulfe> since then hes been a pain

[1]<Sensarity> Thunder he reflects debuffs, wind he absorbs your own buffs
[1]<Sensarity> He does that even if you kill all eles too, so idk if that has anything to do with clearing them out or not
[1]<Sensarity> I only have experience with fighting him after killing all first
