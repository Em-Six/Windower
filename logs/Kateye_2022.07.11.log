Princess Amdina : Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true...I would know why thou dost love me so.
Prince Yahiko : To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
Princess Amdina : <Blush>...My...my prince...I know not what to say...
Prince Yahiko : Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.

{Sylvie} There appears to be a unit separate from Naga Raja out there. Please head to Escha - Ru'Aun (H-9) and investigate.
{Lmine} Hello!

{Sylvie} Uh-oh! He's here! That Naga Raja guy's showed up in Escha - Ru'Aun around H-9, and he seems super duper mad.
{Shermansmith} Hello!

{Sylvie} Oh wow, good job, everyone! That Naga Raja guy in Escha - Ru'Aun is all beaten up. I think we won! Yay!
{Sylvie} Currently, we have taken down 6990 monsters in a row, which gives us a not-so-shabby total of 114609 monsters defeated.
{Xyliana} Hello!

{Sylvie} Okay, everyone! I just had the weirdest vision. In the next 10 minutes, somebody called ‡²Quetzalcoatl‡³ will be showing up in Reisenjima, somewhere around ?-?! Is that good?
{Sylvie} I wonder if those two lovers from the legend ever managed to find each other in the stars... I mean, there are a lot of stars. I'd probably get lost.
