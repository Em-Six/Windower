[2]<Sotrin> We've used BLU for Gaol a few times, mostly when we need a second round - Mighty Guard is great haste, they can -def

[2]<Sotrin> You need to do the Quests Yoss

[2]<Brennski> They can be the 2nd DD on Ngai, work on a bunch of T2s, can do the TP Drain on Mboze

[2]<Sotrin> You don't need to get the full set though

[2]<Tropics> if you are doing 3 NMs in a single entry then someone should have a decked out blu its super useful

[2]<Sotrin> I'm in the final stage for Epeo, had to do the two Empy quests

[2]<Tropics> yeah brd is too good to waste on helping with cures

[2]<Tionishia> whats the most common sub now then?

[2]<Pookibear> nin

[2]<Tropics> /nin 

[2]<Tropics> for the dual wield, remember?

Livingthedream[SSandOria]: Social Linkshell Do you need it? -- MythBeasts is recruiting new, veteran, and returning players -- /tell ^^

[2]<Tionishia> what about /rdm?

[2]<Lunafreya> some of the worst advice ive seen'

[2]<Tionishia> yeah ik

[2]<Lunafreya> you should be brd/pld doing a divine nuke build

[2]<Lunafreya> banish etc

[2]<Tropics> man viable divine nuking would be so cool

[2]<Lunafreya> or brd/smn using summons for autoattack dmg

[2]<Tropics> that would be really fun on pld

[2]<Lunafreya> any other sub pretty worthless on brd if not pld or smn

[2]<Tionishia> divine nuke? 

[2]<Pookibear> they're joking

[2]<Tionishia> cant believe brd becomes the best tank in the game with /pld

[2]<Pookibear> of course, brd/nin is good because of savage blade

[2]<Lunafreya> i solo bumba v20 on brd/pld

[2]<Tropics> ok but jokes aside, brd/pld is used by some for pulling in ody seg farms

[2]<Lunafreya> xD this is ACTUALLY true yes

[2]<Tropics> but thats about as niche as it comes

[2]<Pookibear> yeah but if you're at that level

[2]<Tropics> yeah thats just veteran fully geared brds that are bored and trying stuff

[2]<Pookibear> if you're at that level of bard you'll just have  Sangoma

[2]<Tropics> you will /nin 90% of the time, /whm the other 10% to help with cursna and shit

Livingthedream[SSandOria]: Social Linkshell Do you need it? -- MythBeasts is recruiting new, veteran, and returning players -- /tell ^^

[2]<Tionishia> didnt expect /nin to be that common, thought /whm was for most situations

[2]<Tweedledi> brd/pld is pretty good for thoseg roups that don't have tanks in seg farms, they can do huge pulls with Sentinel

[2]<Tropics> it used to be, but naegling came so DD bard happened, and then carnwenhan got R15

[2]<Tropics> and then nyame

[2]<Tropics> now brd contributes a good amount to dps and is more useful doing that

Bitoshi[Whitegate]: Nyzul Isle token run Do you need it? Looking for members. 2/3 /tell

[2]<Twistedsoul> nageling needs gimped so bad its sad lol

[2]<Pookibear> throw in a few pieces of nyame 

[2]<Holitha> My experience was before carn, I'd do /whm for any alliance content because so much time spent fixing songs

[2]<Tropics> it sort of occupies a similar role to cor where you dont top the parse, but your buffs are super valuable and you can

[2]<Holitha> That it's hard to DD as well

[2]<Tropics> hit 15% or higher on parse if you push it

[2]<Pookibear> the only alliance level content that is hard enough is like, some helms

[2]<Cariko> I enjoyed that Ambu a month or two ago where everyone was doing 99999, so slotting in Carn for AM3 was actually nice

Mopho[Mhaura]: Hmoob Are you alone? /tell Seiike

[2]<Tionishia> i wodner what exactly is it that elevates parties the most besides casting basic songs

[2]<Tropics> nah helms are ideal for dd bard. buff before pop and just go ham

[2]<Tropics> seg farms are the worst for brd

[2]<Holitha> Yeah, it was mostly dyna-D that I had a hard time until I got carn.

[2]<Tropics> because everyone too focused on their parse or whatever to gather for songs. too impatient etc

[2]<Pookibear> we've done ranged for one of the helms so for that bard would be whm

[2]<Brennski> He's saying ppl act stupid

[2]<Cariko> Segs on BRD you're expected to buff everyone, including Pianissimo for the tank/healer, open all the boxes, and still

[2]<Cariko> be #3 on parse somehow

[2]<Pookibear> bard is required for seg farms, its just very fast paced and requires coordination

[2]<Brennski> Make them not have songs for a floor and they'll learn to stay near the BRD

[2]<Brennski> or you can make the COR/WHM open chests

[2]<Brennski> You can open a chest mid cure on WHM

[2]<Tionishia> oh also, cleaving is still best for it on AE i assume

[2]<Pookibear> I do AoE cure V for stoneskin then open chests

[2]<Brennski> That works as well

Casette[Nashmau]: Alexandrite Do you have it? Sell? 3.3k each Thank you.

[2]<Tionishia> my AE set is mostly done except the armor augments

[2]<Holitha> Yeah, it's mostly that for PUG groups they expect a lot out of the bard with no coordination so it can be stressful.

[2]<Pookibear> for an AoE ML party you'll want at least 2 pieces of nyame in your AoE WS set even if it is unaugmented

[2]<Pookibear> just for the DT component

[2]<Yossarianprime> there are these "make your own storybook" services i've seen before

[2]<Yossarianprime> you could make a book featuring you, the wife and ellie?

[2]<Tropics> many of you might remember me insisting that pld was good while bein gmocked lol

[2]<Brennski> Whats the difference from now?

[2]<Cariko> Sakpata

[2]<Tropics> well now i dont get mocked about that, just everything else

[2]<Cariko> PLD got a huge buff from that set, while RUN got... some MAB?

[2]<Brennski> I know about Sakpata Cariko, I litteraly said it like 5 mins ago I was talking about Tropics being mocked

[2]<Cariko> Like I'm going to read more than 8 lines of log

[2]<Brennski> Also PLD99/BLU55 with R15 Burt

[2]<Tropics> cant believe you r15'd it 

Diaferia[Whitegate]: Sleeping Potion Do you have it? Sell?

[2]<Brennski> Atonement spam is amazing

[2]<Tropics> i still dont have anything r15 

[2]<Cariko> >_>? I mean, it's pretty great

[2]<Gerbs> PLD got a huge increase with Sakpata, amd run just got shit on

[2]<Tropics> my burt is like r7 for an insanely long time

Aerox[Rabao]: go seg farm, best sleeping potion around

[2]<Brennski> RUN is currently where BLU was about 4 years ago

[2]<Tropics> and where geo and smn are now

[2]<Brennski> Where its good but it was being used too much, so they didn't put it on the amazing new gear

[2]<Tropics> not nerfed, just not getting anything

[2]<Brennski> like BLU got nothing good in Omen

[2]<Tropics> yeah

Diaferia[Whitegate]: Sleeping Potion Do you have it? Sell?

[2]<Brennski> it took till Mali etc for BLU to get new good gear again

[2]<Gerbs> illibrant ring

Yuceda[Mhaura]: Insect Wing Do you have it? Sell? 20m Reward

[2]<Cariko> yeah, outside of accessories, RUN's "tanking gear" feel like a pile of clothes they found in the corner

Chupame[LowJeuno]: Omen Kin Ring Help me out! please

[2]<Cariko> /sniffsniff "Yeah, good enough."

[2]<Brennski> Pretty much

[2]<Tropics> sounds like run got 4/5 of the main tanking pieces replaced by nyame according to bree earlier

[2]<Cariko> Using two pieces of Nyame path B because... there's just not a lot of good choices.

[2]<Tropics> am i wrong about that?

Diaferia[Whitegate]: Sleeping Potion Do you have it? Sell?

[2]<Cariko> RUN could probably use 4/5 or 5/5 nyame r0 if they wanted. The base stats are sadly better than a lot of options.

[2]<Brennski> I use 3 or 4 pieces for Nyame for tanking

[2]<Brennski> doesn't need to be augged because its DT, HP, Def and Meva are high

[2]<Tropics> it feels like the real deathblow to run is best mindset was moving away from smn burn style shit

Manbearcow[Rabao]: rip

Gyozafairy(E) : Hey do you guys have any tips to make gil? I'm trying to buy maps but the ones I want are kinda expensive

[2]<Cariko> just feels bad somehow

Chupame[LowJeuno]: Omen Kin Ring Help me out! please

Luckicat[Rabao]: RIP me

[2]<Brennski> RUNs death blow was the GEO bubble changes tbh

Qynz[LowJeuno]: Heavy Metal: 25k. Pluton Alexandrite etc..: 1k Lower Jeuno (J-5) Mog House HURRY!!!

[2]<Tropics> rayke/gambit were so importat on everything before

[2]<Brennski> which removed the use of MB Strats

[2]<Tropics> yeah goes hand in hand

Qynz[LowJeuno]: SOLD OUT :)

[2]<Tropics> without rayke/gambit there is not as much reason to take a run. the dps is something i suppose but majesty curing is 

[2]<Tropics> maybe a bi tmore useful

[2]<Tropics> didnt realize this happened to RUN until i started looking into epeo though

[2]<Lunafreya> content is super focused on everyone in DT sets and heals going out often
