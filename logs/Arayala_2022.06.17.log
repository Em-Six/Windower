[2]<Harugaru> what's a good way to practice tanking for someone new to the role?

[2]<Godshatred> depends on what you are doing

[2]<Godshatred> different content is tanked differently

[2]<Godshatred> and you kinda need that job geared just to do it

[2]<Godshatred> most tank gear can be solo farmed for the most part

[2]<Calvino> id say general good advice is learn the enmity moves

[2]<Harugaru> I do have Ashera Harness + Nyame Gear

[2]<Calvino> and how to keep up shadows 

[2]<Harugaru> its the rest that I gotta work on

[2]<Godshatred> im guessing you are trying to tank as RUN then?

[2]<Harugaru> yea

[2]<Calvino> i have no advice, no idea how to run haha. am pld and old 75 era nin hnmtank

[2]<Godshatred> you need an enmity, Phalanx, and -dt sets to start off with i guess

[2]<Godshatred> watch some youtube vids on RUN im guessing, I tank as PLD idk how RUN works honestly

[2]<Harugaru> sounds good, I'll check those out

attackwithme: Slave: Target not found!
attackwithme: Slave: Attack Off
attackwithme: Slave: Attack Off
[2]<Godshatred> for ody you /blu, self buff and then mass pull groups and just AoE spam

[2]<Godshatred> oh, a -spell int set is needed too

[2]<Godshatred> you need 102% 

[2]<Aakor> you dont need that on rune

[2]<Godshatred> ah okay

[2]<Godshatred> i would do a /sea all RUN and then ask them

[2]<Harugaru> ah that's a good idea as well :P

[2]<Calvino> oh shit, aern daggers have 3 less delay than ceremonials

[2]<Calvino> kinda mad about that ngl lol i liked my ceremonials :(

(Kastra) no enemies

(Kastra) well. we need 1 enemy type

(Kastra) so we get them to follow us deep into the zone

(Kastra) and it wont kill them and cause them to HP

(Kastra) should be 1452 nuke

(Kastra) nice

(Kastra) so the skill caps on BG are 25 too low

Xiaofg[BastokMine]: Crawlers' Nest [S] 500p/4m ML 0-20/15m 0-40/100m R15 V19 SAM IGEO CBRD VERY Fast Cast

(Kastra) idk about ichi skillcap, but it's probably 25 too low too

(Kastra) idk the skill floor since we started late

(Sensarity) good news

(Kastra) but 273skill was 270dmg

(Sensarity) arayala has a whopping 1 ninjutsu

(Kastra) and 276 skill was 270dmg

(Kastra) skill floor probably fine

(Kastra) so we can estimate ichi without even testing it

(Kastra) just make it 2.125

(Kastra) maybe when they "buffed" ninja

Zengetsu[Rabao]: Morning  Asura 

(Kastra) but didnt mention the damage increase

(Sensarity) really makes  you wonder how it went under the radar

(Sensarity) or that yeah

Redwoods[Norg]: *** Crepuscular Helm * in pool * 150M * Palborough Mines Waughroon Shrine

(Kastra) when they adjusted merits and relic augments

(Kastra) made san spells buyable

(Kastra) and i guess updated the damage formula

Cega[Selbina]: Good morning!

(Kastra) but M and V remained the same, just made higher skill cap

Xiaofg[BastokMine]: Crawlers' Nest [S] 500p/4m ML 0-20/15m 0-40/100m R15 V19 SAM IGEO CBRD VERY Fast Cast

(Kastra) because adjusting coefficients is hard

(Kastra) easier to say +25 to skill

(Sensarity) yeah

(Sensarity) makes sense

(Kastra) 12.5% increase to ninjutsu damage

(Kastra) i vaguely recall damage feeling stronger then

(Kastra) but we also lost our relic head augments to feet, which means we coudnt use AF feet

(Kastra) so it kinda balanced

(Kastra) the head used to be +82 magic attack and +25% damage with merits

(Sensarity) that's insane
