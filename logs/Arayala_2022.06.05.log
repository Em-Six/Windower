[2]<Turntablst> hmm maybe i'm not so sure myself atm lol to get all the good stuff for the month

[2]<Twistedsoul> a lot its 10800 per run, so if ur talking about being able to buy every single  thing...a lot lol

[2]<Arayala> You need 284,500 hallmarks to buy all the gil items
[2]<Arayala> You can do the math on how many runs that is yourself
[2]<Keaddo> to be fair, most of it is pointless

[2]<Keaddo> dynamis currencies are worthless, not worth the points

[2]<Twistedsoul> btw if ur buying wins just to sell gil items, its kinda pointless because ur basically only breaking even

[2]<Keaddo> you begin with HMPs, then move onto riftcinders, then alexandrite

[2]<Twistedsoul> diagree

[2]<Keaddo> and if you have more, you go for H-P, but that's already not really worth it
