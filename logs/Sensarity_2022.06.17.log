(Kastra) so we can do it

(Kastra) need to take them to a SAFE zone

(Kastra) with lots of open space

(Kastra) we can mount btw

(Kastra) a safe zone with lots of space

(Kastra) if we can make it to Hall of the Gods

(Kastra) lot of room to pos hack

(Kastra) no enemies

(Kastra) well. we need 1 enemy type

(Kastra) that doesnt aggro

(Kastra) so we get them to follow us deep into the zone

(Kastra) and it wont kill them and cause them to HP

(Kastra) so the skill caps on BG are 25 too low

(Sensarity) good news
(Kastra) but 273skill was 270dmg

(Kastra) that means potency bonus cap is 2.125

(Kastra) matches san with 500 skill

(Kastra) so we can estimate ichi without even testing it

(Kastra) just make it 2.125

(Sensarity) Nice
(Kastra) 275

(Kastra) so +25

(Kastra) some ninja-patch to ninjutsu

(Kastra) maybe when they "buffed" ninja

(Kastra) but didnt mention the damage increase

(Sensarity) really makes  you wonder how it went under the radar
(Sensarity) or that yeah
(Kastra) when they adjusted merits and relic augments

(Kastra) made san spells buyable

(Kastra) and i guess updated the damage formula

(Kastra) but M and V remained the same, just made higher skill cap

(Kastra) because adjusting coefficients is hard

(Kastra) easier to say +25 to skill

(Sensarity) yeah
(Sensarity) makes sense
(Kastra) 12.5% increase to ninjutsu damage

(Kastra) i vaguely recall damage feeling stronger then

>>Asalith : You planning to do a segment any time soon
(Kastra) but we also lost our relic head augments to feet, which means we coudnt use AF feet

(Kastra) so it kinda balanced

>>Asalith : also fuck me, just as I said I didn't feel the heat at night, last night was awful
(Kastra) the head used to be +82 magic attack and +25% damage with merits

Asalith>> ><

(Sensarity) that's insane
Asalith>> itwas actually alright for me 

Asalith>> I woke up once then passed back out instantly

(Kastra) eh. my code still isnt agreeing for ni spells

>>Asalith : I wish I could do that
(Kastra) M=0.501, V=124.2

Asalith>> tbh it's super rare for me too XD

(Kastra) thats a future me problem

(Kastra) thats enough for today

Wintur>> yea when i was running with him im just like wtf is going on 

>>Wintur : Very efficient
Wintur>> saw hidhaegg runnin around chasing him and shit, then realized there was no tank in the group

(Erenjaeger) all going again?

(Sensarity) I only have time for this one sadly
(Rafiann) sure ill od another

(Erenjaeger) k sens

(Rafiann) 10% is 1400 rp 0.o, how much does a kill give you

Wintur>> i didnt want to bug him to see his midcast sets but i assume there are nothing special or probably just 

Wintur>> nyame instead of AF

(Erenjaeger) 2100ish

(Rafiann) not even worth killin.....

(Rafiann) thought it qwould be like 14k

(Sensarity) It's only that high because of Amp, you get like 35 RP without it
(Rafiann) ahh okay

(Sensarity) Amp lowers the threshhold for gaining a decent amount of RP, on top of 3x multiplier
>>Wintur : Probably yeah
(Rafiann) makes sense i guess, ive heard v20 is a cluster fk

Wintur>> then all i have left to do is 5 fights on v20 and i can pop v20 bumba

>>Wintur : If you need a COR/WAR or BRD for any let me know
Wintur>> fucking marmokrebs...

(Erenjaeger) V20 bumba isnt THAT bad kill wise with a good group

>>Wintur : I need the v20 T3s also
(Erenjaeger) its getting to the point where u can pop him is the annoying bit

Wintur>> biggest hurdles gonna be marm/ongo/mboze probably

>>Wintur : yeah
Wintur>> but im like 70% positive marm can be rng/cor burned

>>Wintur : Possible
(Poppadom) popping v20 bumba is easy

(Poppadom) just ask a mate to do it

(Erenyeager) -.-

(Erenyeager) -kick- :P

(Rafiann) ive heard erenyeager does it if you ask him nicely

Wintur>> if leaden/trueflight can hit for at least 10k each

(Rafiann) gotta say please though

Wintur>> only means 100ish of them need to be fired off in 13 min

>>Wintur : Idk how high is magic defense is
>>Wintur : But my leadens are like 30kish
Wintur>> on marm specifically?

>>Wintur : If you set up a SC for it it'd be even better
>>Wintur : I've not done Marm on COR, so idk how it is on him
Wintur>> yea marm is like ongo practice

Wintur>> just thunder instead of earth basically
