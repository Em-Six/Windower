[2]<Tionishia> the better question would be, is it even worth it for a pld to create an ATK Bonus combo

[2]<Oldegregg> no

[2]<Pookibear> no the damage spells are just for tagging mobs

[2]<Tionishia> oh okay so uppercut is the tagger

Zanbuza[Whitegate]: Nyzul Isle Token farm Do you need it? Team up? @5

[2]<Tionishia> although.. foot kick is also in my list
