(Sensarity) Yeah I was wondering how easy it is to Ooze Kalunga

(Romb) never really tried but ive heard its one of the easier ones

(Sensarity) good to know

(Romb) bumba>mbose>kalunga are the decently landable ones

(Sensarity) Was considering mercing some on Arayala since she has access now while I do it for Sensarity

(Sensarity) cos I could use the gil

(Romb) next one with war gonna wait till 3 mins pull

(Sensarity) kk

(Sensarity) dont wanna lose those EP huh

Arayala is no longer weakened.
(Romb) ya that and... if we dont get 5% in 3 mins... wouldnt get 5% anyways

(Sensarity) true

(Sensarity) can RD/Wild card you too so

(Sensarity) should have good odds

(Romb) you got full power rolls?

(Sensarity) ye

(Romb) kk was gonna cor romb but thats better

(Sensarity) I'll mostly be playing kat since heals more important so jusat way when you want RD/WC

(Romb) well im hoping 5% at least during Mighty Strikes

(Sensarity) should be manageable

(Romb) 1 min and done

Boghetti[WestAdoulin]: Omen Kin Do you need it? 4/6
