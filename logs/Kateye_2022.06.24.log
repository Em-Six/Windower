Sett[NSandOria]: Did I just see someone say that a womans womb isnt her body ._.?

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: That is not their body numb nuts. That's the baby's body

{Sylvie} Did you know that the geomantic luopans used to be a lot bigger? They've only started miniaturizing them a few decades ago. You used to have to wield it over your shoulder and make sure nobody was behind you before using it.
{Sylvie} Okay, everyone! I just had the weirdest vision. In the next 10 minutes, somebody called ‡²Quetzalcoatl‡³ will be showing up in Reisenjima, somewhere around ?-?! Is that good?
Drkzoul[Whitegate]: Odyssey C seg Farm Do you need it? TANK BRD Can I have it? /tell 4/6

Phillie[Rabao]: i found this clothes hanger here..

Uwansong[LowJeuno]: if abortion is murder i just did a holocaust in your mother's hair

Zoomzoombroom[WindWoods]: Truth is harsh - that pro-lifer's only care about that 'life' until it comes out... then no help at all.

Windygarden[WindWalls]: basically a cancer

Obanieth[WindWoods]: is there a linkpearl welcoming a new player or something? I have no idea what I'm doing beyond nation missions :D

Zoomzoombroom[WindWoods]: It's a moral high horse they ride upon to seem 'quite devout' and earn that seat in heaven next to the cheezus

Uwansong[LowJeuno]: "it moves" is your requirement for something to have human rights?

{Chingyboo} /

Thewilltolive[Norg]: it's mostly liberals that want abortions, let them do it, less liberals, win/win

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: well, no, by that logic you should go abort yourself then

Shirokazesan[PortWind]: I thought I logged onto FFXI, and apparently I came into Twitter. Hate it when that happens.

Razuu[Mhaura]: time to start rapin' repubs

Uwansong[LowJeuno]: i wish i could abort myself, but it's a bit late

Dremma[LowJeuno]: It isn't fully grown is your criteria for it not being a human?

Windygarden[WindWalls]: no, its women that cannot afford to have thier lives ended suddenly. and over 1/2 are done by ppl with children.

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: why? I thought you were all advocating late term abortions, including ones out of the womb?

Dremma[LowJeuno]: you have fewer brain cells than pixles on a tarutaru nose

Curtle[LowJeuno]: I had a brain cell once

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: Projection at its finest. You can stick to something you're good at. Like licking windows

Mighel[LowJeuno]: you are missed aborts

{Sylvie} There appears to be a unit separate from Quetzalcoatl out there. Please head to Reisenjima (?-?) and investigate.
Razuu[Mhaura]: my dad-uncle and  mom-sister said abortions are the devil

Arayala[Norg]: Reading this chat makes me wish I was aborted
