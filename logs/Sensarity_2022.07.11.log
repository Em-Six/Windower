[1]<Brennski> Daybreak, Homilary

[1]<Brennski> thats like 6 refresh of the top of my head

[1]<Brennski> 2 Sitkinis +1 for another 2

[1]<Sensarity> yeah okay
[1]<Sensarity> that's similar to what I think I did for hers
[1]<Eione> daybreak, genmei shield/ring, dring, stikini, staunch, nya head/hands/feet, twilight neck, assid pants, etiolation

[1]<Sensarity> Think I did mallquis feet for the 11% damage > MP also, but idk how worth it that is
[1]<Brennski> Shamash or AF Body +3 is 3 Refresh but more Meva/Def

Bastion Prefect : The outpost is under attack by the Abyssean hordes!We lack the manpower to end it quickly! Those fit to wield a blade, report to the outpost with all haste!
[1]<Eione> don't have either

Using Warp Ring, /heal to cancel.
[1]<Eione> yet

Instant Warp not available or ready for use.
[1]<Brennski> yea i just meant if you have them I'd use those over Jharki

[1]<Eione> jhakri robe +2 is what I used

Bastion Prefect : Red alert! The enemy has destroyed the pulse martello!All arms, retreat to safety!
Bastion Prefect : Curses! The enemy is attempting to make off with the EX-05 martello core! We must retrieve it!
Bastion Prefect : Today was not to be...but a single battle does not decide the outcome of war.We must regroup and ready ourselves for the next clash.
[1]<Eione> I wish all the guides would just have a section "cape augments"

[1]<Sensarity> Yup
[1]<Sensarity> "here's all the capes you need"
[1]<Eione> exactly

[1]<Eione> "these ones are essential, these ones are good to have, these ones are useful occationally"

[1]<Sensarity> same with af/relic/empy gear, just so it's obvious which to prioritise
[1]<Eione> yeah and which ones are fine at +2 for example

[1]<Brennski> I only have 1 for SCH

[1]<Brennski> INT MAcc MAB

[1]<Eione> ironically that is one I wouldn't use xD

[1]<Brennski> Use Fi-follet for FC and Aursits for Enfeebles

[1]<Brennski> you get the regen duration on the base cape

[1]<Brennski> and can use Reive cape if you want pot

[1]<Brennski> Idle in Moonbow/Moonlight

[1]<Brennski> Mages generally get away with 1 or 2 ambu capes

[1]<Brennski> other than RDM or BRD

[1]<Eione> quick scan suggests af head, relic head/body, emp head/hands as priority

[1]<Brennski> yea and maybe Relic Legs to i109 for longer Tabula Rasa

Using Warp Ring, /heal to cancel.
[1]<Eione> given that I believe that is a 1hr thing I'll make it but later

[Sensarity] warp ring ¨ Sensarity
[1]<Brennski> I mostly use Empy hands on SCH

[1]<Brennski> the Relic head is nuking piece
