{Apururu} Bad news! Have you heard of Naga Raja? Well they say he's appeared in Escha - Ru'Aun (H-9) and seems very upsetaru!
{Mayall} .

{Apururu} Thank goodness! It looks like that naughty-waughty Naga Raja in Escha - Ru'Aun is no more. And it looks like our girl got away just fine-wine.
{Apururu} Hmm... I believe we've defeated 7329 monsters in a row. That makes for a total-wotal of 69377 monsters.
