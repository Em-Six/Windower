[1]<Kiouki> well not everyone can 6box content and with time issues not everyone can run stuff with ls..

[1]<Kiouki> and these ppl pay too..

[1]<Aigulfe> yeah  is what i was saying earlier, its far from ideal for someone who has a whole LS of ppl to consider

[1]<Levia> I got a T shirt on 14 for not being able to log when endwalker came out xd

[2]<Arayala> yea

[2]<Arayala> so

[2]<Arayala> Tonight

[2]<Arayala> We should probably have Gnar prequeue while we do segs

[2]<Yuceda> lol

[2]<Arayala> as long as party leader stays in the zone, it's fine even if everyone leaves

[2]<Arayala> it's what I did while I did Dynamis on Sens

[2]<Arayala> Just need to queue with the same number of people as you'll have when you wanna enter

[1]<Aldolol> take it, its like odyssey queue where nyone other than leader can zone out?

[1]<Aigulfe> yeah pothers can zone and u can swap non leaderrts

[1]<Aldolol> queue has moved 10 in 30 minutes lol

[2]<Warmoose> oye

[1]<Aigulfe> the obdella is in th Nostos Defoliators!

[2]<Warmoose> i'd say Bumba is atleast 200M

[2]<Yuceda> yep

[2]<Warmoose> you gotta figure you're wasting 5 dudes segments

[2]<Warmoose> they can secure a V20 anything else for 1 kill at 100-120m

[2]<Warmoose> and bumba might take 2 tries

[2]<Warmoose> so why would i do it for anything less, if im potentially losing the segs that i could use to sell 2 ongos

[2]<Arayala> could take more than 2 depending on 1h RNG

[2]<Yuceda> ^

[2]<Warmoose> people can be penny pinching all they want

[2]<Warmoose> then go work and get your flow down with your own static for 1-2 yeras

[2]<Warmoose> and get your own dam clear

[2]<Warmoose> or go gamble all the segs with a PUG

[2]<Warmoose> is what i'd tell this particular person

[2]<Warmoose> that i have no clue is

[2]<Warmoose> that wants to buy V20 bumba

[2]<Yuceda> I'll tell him 200m 

[2]<Yuceda> No less

[2]<Uvyu> I'm down to merc bumba, I wanna finish Burtgang

[2]<Warmoose> dude and if its a no win, i still think its a 100M deposit. and we just keep going until kill

[2]<Warmoose> because we all know we're squared away on our jobs

[2]<Warmoose> loss is either because he didnt listen, or unlucky aura

[2]<Warmoose> not gonna burn 6k segs, and walk away empty handed

[2]<Yuceda> Ok so, 200m win, how much per attempt?

Jcnnifcr earns a merit point! (Total: 26)
[2]<Uvyu> 5m seems like a slap in the face to us.

[2]<Uvyu> But that's the price of 2 bumba Rp nowadays

[2]<Warmoose> just 100M, and that'll get your 3 attempts to bake in murphy

[2]<Warmoose> 100M on win

[2]<Uvyu> Yo 

[2]<Uvyu> Will anyone go for chances?

[2]<Uvyu> Like 50mil for x attempts.

[2]<Warmoose> well i think 3 max and we can get it off luck/auras

[2]<Yuceda> Tbh, i don't want to waste our time and segs w/o securing some payment.

[2]<Warmoose> we could get it on 1

[2]<Uvyu> Hum

[2]<Warmoose> we could get it on 3

[2]<Uvyu> We've been known to get it on 7.

[2]<Warmoose> only other way to do it is 200M flat for win, and 3M per attempt since he's getting RP

[2]<Warmoose> but 40M to burn up segs until a win still seems wack

[2]<Uvyu> Right

[2]<Uvyu> I'd rather them pay per attempts

[2]<Yuceda> Well, we have to come up with some numbers that we all agree on.

[2]<Uvyu> 50mil for 2 tries or something

[2]<Uvyu> Could get it in 50

[2]<Uvyu> Could get it in 200

[2]<Uvyu> WOuld have to have a hard cap for that though

The area's colonization rate has increased to 80%.
[2]<Warmoose> if we think it'll take 50 tries, then we shouldnt entertain the idea

[2]<Uvyu> Or someone would pay us 600mil to not win

[2]<Warmoose> out of the 3x i've went for win. 1 was 1/1, one was 6%, bad aura, win, last atempt

[2]<Warmoose> wwas 3%, bad aura, win

[2]<Warmoose> you can tell when the group is on track and performing, and its just shit luck of WC/RD/aura

[2]<Yuceda> I think 50m per attempt, caps at 200m, +100m (or 150) if win b4 3 tries.

[2]<Warmoose> so what happens when you do 1 for 50M and win

[2]<Warmoose> 10M each?

[2]<Yuceda> Read mfr -.-

[2]<Yuceda> 50m a try, if we win then +150m

[2]<Uvyu> Or

[2]<Yuceda> upto the 3rd try

[2]<Warmoose> brb another fb marketplace sale

[2]<Yuceda> k

[2]<Yuceda> So the less we makewould be 200m if we win in 1 try.

[2]<Arayala> sounds decent

[2]<Yuceda> 50m attempt UPTO 3 tries and win woulb be 100 or 150 up to the group

[2]<Uvvu> Hum

[2]<Yuceda> House wins in any scenario

[2]<Uvyu> Hum

[2]<Yuceda> can make from 200 to 300m if win on 3rd try OR 150m for 3 tries with no win

[2]<Yuceda> Yeeees sweet cheeks? :)

[2]<Uvyu> THinkin
