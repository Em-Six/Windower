[2]<Tropics> colibri era is when i quit my first char

[2]<Aakor> that could also just be vol2 ambu

[2]<Tropics> because i played blm primarily and thats when the job got ruined and became a slow solo job

{Apururu} Thank goodness! It looks like that naughty-waughty Azi Dahaka in Escha - Zi'Tah is no more. And it looks like our girl got away just fine-wine.
{Apururu} Hmm... I believe we've defeated 5408 monsters in a row. That makes for a total-wotal of 113027 monsters.
[2]<Tropics> every blm soloing on chigoes and pets

[2]<Tropics> yea

[2]<Bedavere> this time, i have my doubts finally

[2]<Bedavere> yep

[2]<Tropics> but no reason to grind

[2]<Bedavere> im still a good 75% Leaning in on 2 new jobs 

[2]<Bedavere> talk to me in a year

[2]<Twistedsoul> lol keep dreaming

(Hyrue) /

[2]<Bedavere> always

[2]<Tropics> i just want them to add something that makes the grinds worth it

[2]<Bedavere> damn right

[2]<Tropics> grind MLs for odyssey, grind odyssey for augs

[2]<Tropics> then do what

(Anigav) nice need 1 more

[2]<Aakor> play other games

[2]<Tropics> kill everything in the game we can already kill without any of that

[2]<Arayala> this game is a skinner box
[2]<Bedavere> god hat egoing with this guy to segs but dont care tonight got 2 tags;

[2]<Arayala> there's no need for it to have a goal for gearing/grinding up to
[2]<Arayala> the gring is and has always been the game when it comes to ffxi
[2]<Bedavere> if anything 11  has taught me to not have goals in life

[2]<Tropics> if they added a crazy tought megaboss 

[2]<Tropics> then i might do the grinds just to work on beating it

[2]<Aakor> they're adding v25s, the v20s are already a good chalenge, v25 will be very hard

[2]<Tropics> yeah but ody is really stupid imo

[2]<Aakor> well thats the game now

[2]<Tropics> just scaling up nms we already beat

[2]<Bedavere> i remember someone saying theyll never add storage; NEVER Load times, Ps2 limitations blahblah. 

[2]<Tropics> yeah thats why i said im worried about the direction

[2]<Tropics> what they are focused on adding is not as good as what they have done in the past

[2]<Tropics> and its kind of a lame way to end the best game ever

[2]<Aakor> if you dont like ML grinding or Odyssey the game is kinda pointless to log into

[2]<Twistedsoul> ur not getting new jobs or a full on expansion, most u may get would be a new add on senario, this game doesnt make 

[2]<Tropics> well i like building rema and gearing jobs

[2]<Twistedsoul> enough for them to sink enough recources into this game for that

[2]<Bedavere> 50 is gonna be cap right? i kinda remember the video saying 50 is gonna be but maybe i heard wrong

[2]<Aakor> ml50 yes

[2]<Tropics> im ignoring ody, but have been doing MLs

[2]<Bedavere> yea thought so

[2]<Twistedsoul> ml50 for Long time yeah

[2]<Godshatred> question. So I have only cleared Kalunga v0 and had multiple failed v20s. Why is the game letting me augment it to v

[2]<Godshatred> v15?

[2]<Godshatred> is it because i've failed v20, or because I have t1/t2 v20 unlocked now

Miniulti[RuLudeGard]: any Dynamis - San d'Oria (D) W1 being done?

[2]<Efx> you have the previous tier cleared to v15 which unlocks that tier at v15 i think

Miniulti[RuLudeGard]: any Dynamis - San d'Oria (D) W1 being done?

[2]<Brennski> They changed it I think, so you can rank up to R15 with a V0 clear

Kimastar[Mhaura]: ML/CP Do you need it? Can I have it? COR? 5/6

[2]<Brennski> Then V15 unlocks R20 and V20 unlocks R25

[2]<Godshatred> ah cool

Guernsey[PSandOria]: nah, i did'nt. . . I really didn't . . . Trump is just f**king terrible.

[2]<Terrorized> most of the KI can come from gold chest

Jayqwellin[Rabao]: Oddy C Seg Farm Do you need it? Veteran Brd Can I have it? /tell 5/6

[2]<Aakor> we didnt gold box at all for pixie, that took less than 2 hours

Weapon[LowJeuno]: trueeee. $2 gas was worth getting hate crimed

[2]<Aakor> the oboron we gold farmed and NM and was like 3 hours

[2]<Terrorized> yeah pixie isnt gold chest i think

Guernsey[PSandOria]: he also had Cheeto's for hair and a sexual relationship with his daughter, whats your point here?

[2]<Aakor> and the dragon took like 5 hours

[2]<Terrorized> yeah dragon is super easy

Chharith[RuLudeGard]: yall making stories up now lol

Catnipthief[Rabao]: $2 gas effected my life alot more than ur made up situation weapon 

[2]<Terrorized> can do it in a few hours with gold chests/kur

[2]<Aakor> it wouldve been a bit less on dragon but we afked for 30 mins and got that dirmite fang like 70% 

[2]<Aakor> of the time >_>

Guernsey[PSandOria]: actually, i'm speaking to middle westerners here, a sexual relationship with your daughter is pretty mainstream. M

Weapon[LowJeuno]: being a brown person in TX isn't a made up situation. ty tho

Catnipthief[Rabao]: with $2 gas u can afford to drive somewhere else then

Guernsey[PSandOria]: why would I do that when that psychopath manchild fuckwit isnt in the Whitehouse?

[2]<Aakor> depending on empy+3 i might even reroll 1-2 pieces of nyame for path A

[2]<Brennski> Also depends on the 4th aug slot they are adding

Catnipthief[Rabao]: u seem upset. $6 gas might be the cause of that

[2]<Aakor> that too

Miniulti[LowJeuno]: how about u both fucking abort this conversation ffs

Endrium[SSandOria]: He had TDS, its ok

[2]<Terrorized> i hope i can put all of my relic/af on slips

[2]<Terrorized> if i can just use ody/empy

Miniulti[LowJeuno]: any Dynamis - San d'Oria (D) W1 being done?

[2]<Aakor> well.... relic for the most part is still just for macro pieces on JA

[2]<Brennski> Yea

[2]<Terrorized> yeah

Guernsey[PSandOria]: I'm not upset, because I'm a man in America. Its the women who are upset, philistine.

[2]<Terrorized> but i stopped using the wsd10 pieces

[2]<Aakor> theres a few to keep using but for the most part yeah, slips!

[2]<Aakor> it'll take quite a bit to ever beat shit like cor relic feet + 3

[2]<Aakor> you know, if the best 4th slot would just be +2 stats on each level.... +10 all stats would help so much

[2]<Terrorized> im about to retire my cor but i feel like i'd be putting DP to waste

[2]<Aakor> since that set has lower base stats

[2]<Aakor> i'd RP it for that

[2]<Aakor> i guess i shouldnt say "the best" but it'd be a nice slot imo

Catnipthief[Rabao]: do u remember when putin had a puppet in the white house but instead waited till that guy left to start a war?

[2]<Terrorized> if they added wsd5 on each sakpata piece, i'd never have to swap gear

Miniulti[LowJeuno]: any Dynamis - San d'Oria (D) W1 being done?

Odysseuss[Mhaura]: I don't mind paying double or triple prices, long as cable new script readers are happy.

[2]<Terrorized> same for path A nyame

Catnipthief[Rabao]: i am willing to pay $30 a gallon if it means i dont have to read mean tweets 

[2]<Terrorized> but thats wishful thinking

[2]<Aakor> subtle blow II

[2]<Aakor> You can have this.

[2]<Brennski> STP or PDL on Nyame would be nice

[2]<Brennski> or some more acc

Miniulti[LowJeuno]: big brother of bamba

[2]<Brennski> hell I'd take 10 acc per piece on Nyame as the 4th aug

[2]<Arayala> if path b gets PDL that'll be disgusting

Echored[BastokMark]: ah lalala mumba lalala bumba, ah la mumba dananana

Bolverk[Rabao]: Mumba Samba

[2]<Aakor> +10 stats on each piece would be fantastic, and still realistic i think

[2]<Hunterspike> hmm is 498 blue magic skill good enough to learn blu magic lol

[2]<Terrorized> just let me make 4 sets of nyame and i can slip everything else

[2]<Brennski> 10 stats would be nice or even some acc

[2]<Aakor> thats some lazy shit that SE loves to do

[2]<Aakor> 10 stats = acc

[2]<Brennski> good point

[2]<Aakor> 50 more int/mnd for nukes/debuffs

[2]<Aakor> i think its the type of shit they'd do

[2]<Aakor> but it could just be 5acc/atk/m.acc too (on all sets because fuck it)
