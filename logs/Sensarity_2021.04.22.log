[1]<Brunht> Nice R0

{Yoran-Oran} Our field researchers have sent a report-ethy from ?-? in Reisenjima. Apparently, monsters affiliated with Quetzalcoatl have arrived there. Those guys are always getting themselves into trouble.
[1]<Brunht> Not sure if that reset it or not lol

[1]<Gesetz> womp womp

[1]<Gesetz> what was that for?

[1]<Brunht> ROV

{Lowlifex} Hello!

[1]<Gesetz> shouldn't have reset anything then

{Yoran-Oran} Our field researchers in Reisenjima have reported that Quetzalcoatl has appeared around ?-?. What a rare research-ethy opportunity!
[1]<Gesetz> as long as it was set

[1]<Brunht> The progress resets on leaving the zone, but I'm 99% sure it didnt

[1]<Brunht> Killing one with trusts to make sure

[1]<Gesetz> can just check from the quest menu

[1]<Gesetz> wait

[1]<Brunht> Thanks for the help

[1]<Gesetz> np

{Yoran-Oran} Excellent! The Quetzalcoatl specimen from Reisenjima has been successfully defeated-ethy!
{Yoran-Oran} Hmm... Let's see how our research is progressing! We've defeated-ethy 2359 monsters in a row, bringing our total to 64407 monsters...
[1]<Gesetz> feel free to hit me up with any other things you may need help with

Moogle : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with faint light energy, kupo!
The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo.Please trade an Imperial bronze piece to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
[1]<Brunht> I'll see if RoV has anymore road blocks.

[1]<Brunht> Should be fine I think for now
