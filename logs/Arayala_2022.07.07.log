Zigal[WindWoods]: Pluton Can I have it? 1.1k ea. /tell please @ 7840

[2]<Yossarianprime> quick q. so once i get the base set, i need a v1 clear, then i can rp up to 5? 15? and then i max and have to get a 

[2]<Yossarianprime> 15 clear?

Page 663 of the tome flares up!
[2]<Arayala> 12 runs to R25 if you kill each attempt
[2]<Arayala> You're looking realistically somewhere in the middle for avarage runs
[2]<Arayala> A good segment group with a premade (if you're clearing V20s, you will have a premade) is about 12k segments
[2]<Arayala> which is 2.6 runs
[2]<Arayala> so you're looking at maybe a week and a half per piece
[2]<Arayala> Most pieces come online way before R25, so if you focus on getting to R20 first on all pieces, you can do it even 
[2]<Arayala> quicker

Page 666 of the tome flares up!
[2]<Yossarianprime> i was doing some reading too, is it true most of the v0s are pretty easy?  

[2]<Arayala> i.e, you want to RP your Nyame, a Gogamgog V1 will unlock spending RP, but you still need Bumba RP to upgrade Nyame
[2]<Arayala> All V0s are a cakewalk
Covid[NSandOria]: the Prime Minister position in the United Kingdom is in need

[2]<Darkdrgn> then why do ppl charge like 8m for a bumba clear lol

[2]<Yossarianprime> access

[2]<Arayala> Because of the time investment involved to get there, and also because people are willing to pay it
[2]<Arayala> They will charge as much as people will pay
