[2]<Castilian> Ok I have a quesiton, Is it literallty impossible to tank bertter than Val when hearding the idiots we call trusts?

[2]<Skilledretahd> val is quite a beast

[2]<Wumbo> What level?

[2]<Castilian> I can;t keep any sort of hate in Ambu because the healer has no choice but to spam AoE heals

Sesshmaru[Rabao]: Ongo V20 Looking for members. BRD 5/6

[2]<Skilledretahd> for v1?

[2]<Castilian> I tried regular 119 and just let muself die as it was going so badly after like 60 seconds

[2]<Castilian> yet i cna sit back and do nothing and still win at 119 if i use val

[2]<Castilian> Am I supposed to be able to do this without using him? Every trust member who wif human would be out of AoE range

[2]<Castilian> just hug the mobs and get hit with AoE damage]

[2]<Castilian> And RUN isn't exactly a AoE hate generation beast.

[2]<Wumbo> It's Ambu, so whatever works is the right way

[1]<Kiiry> I can't find any Satellite Guns

[1]<Kiiry> Do you have a rough placement idea

[2]<Castilian> I guess, it;s just made me regret leveling RUN and want to drop it for being totally useless

[2]<Aakor> Rune is probably the BEST aoe hate generation job in the entire game

[1]<Ornstien> Yes

[1]<Ornstien> i know exactly where

[2]<Wumbo> RUN is perfectly fine. Every job just takes a while to gear up to being able to solo higher content

[2]<Keaddo> it's fine to suck, take your time to improve and you'll suck less

Nukito[WestAdoulin]: Wildskeeper Reive Where? /tell

[2]<Castilian> What is it supposed to do to generate AoE hate? The only thing I nkow of it using /BLU and spamming spells

[2]<Aakor> i dont even /blu on rune

[2]<Aakor> /drk all the way

[2]<Aakor> tag mobs with poisonga and use foil
