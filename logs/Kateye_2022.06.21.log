{Sylvie} Uh-oh! He's here! That Quetzalcoatl guy's showed up in Reisenjima around ?-?, and he seems super duper mad.
{Sylvie} Oh wow, good job, everyone! That Quetzalcoatl guy in Reisenjima is all beaten up. I think we won! Yay!
{Sylvie} Currently, we have taken down 4687 monsters in a row, which gives us a not-so-shabby total of 112306 monsters defeated.
{Sylvie} Okay, everyone! I just had the weirdest vision. In the next 10 minutes, somebody called ‡²Azi Dahaka‡³ will be showing up in Escha - Zi'Tah, somewhere around H-8! Is that good?

{Sylvie} Oh wow, good job, everyone! That Quetzalcoatl guy in Reisenjima is all beaten up. I think we won! Yay!
{Sylvie} Currently, we have taken down 4693 monsters in a row, which gives us a not-so-shabby total of 112312 monsters defeated.
{Sylvie} Okay, everyone! I just had the weirdest vision. In the next 10 minutes, somebody called ‡²Azi Dahaka‡³ will be showing up in Escha - Zi'Tah, somewhere around H-8! Is that good?
