[2]<Agrestic> did yuceda's earring come from an NQ box or did he get a +1 box?

[2]<Sensarity> because they have to make SOME changes

[2]<Sensarity> NQ box

[2]<Agrestic> I hope you only get +1/+2 earrings from +1 boxes

[2]<Sensarity> My theory is NQ box has a low % to be +1, +1 box has a low % chance to be +2

[2]<Sensarity> with the minimum earring being equivalent to the box's level
