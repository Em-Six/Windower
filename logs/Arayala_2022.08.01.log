[2]<Isobelrose> so i didnt know

[2]<Nauthima> pretty sure it's against the ToS

[2]<Twistedsoul> LOL SE care about the ToS on a 20+ year old game with a small player count? hardly

[2]<Twistedsoul> if they did all the easy farmers and bots would be gone

[2]<Isobelrose> only 6 developers

[2]<Yottaxa> or the galka armies

[2]<Isobelrose> so i doubt they care

[2]<Kaykosan> 10/10 do not care. 

[2]<Tionishia> how many people are playng this game daily

[2]<Kaykosan> this is free money for them. 

[2]<Twistedsoul> maybe 50kl

[2]<Twistedsoul> 50k is prob  a high estimate

[2]<Relisaa> 100k according to devs

[2]<Isobelrose> they used to care, but people stopped playing

[2]<Relisaa> but 50% is probably bots

[2]<Twistedsoul> 100k with half of those being mules at least so 50k is about right

[2]<Isobelrose> of that 100k how many is 1 person with 8 accounts or bots
