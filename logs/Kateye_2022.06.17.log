(Kastra) but when you went >275 you got SOME multiplier

(Kastra) nice

(Kastra) so the skill caps on BG are 25 too low

(Kastra) idk about ichi skillcap, but it's probably 25 too low too

(Kastra) idk the skill floor since we started late

(Sensarity) good news

(Kastra) but 273skill was 270dmg

(Sensarity) arayala has a whopping 1 ninjutsu

(Kastra) and 276 skill was 270dmg

{Sylvie} Uh-oh! He's here! That Azi Dahaka guy's showed up in Escha - Zi'Tah around H-8, and he seems super duper mad.

Zengetsu[Rabao]: Morning  Asura 

(Kastra) but didnt mention the damage increase

(Sensarity) really makes  you wonder how it went under the radar

(Sensarity) or that yeah

Redwoods[Norg]: *** Crepuscular Helm * in pool * 150M * Palborough Mines Waughroon Shrine

(Kastra) when they adjusted merits and relic augments

(Kastra) made san spells buyable

(Kastra) and i guess updated the damage formula

Cega[Selbina]: Good morning!

(Kastra) but M and V remained the same, just made higher skill cap

Xiaofg[BastokMine]: Crawlers' Nest [S] 500p/4m ML 0-20/15m 0-40/100m R15 V19 SAM IGEO CBRD VERY Fast Cast

(Kastra) because adjusting coefficients is hard

(Kastra) easier to say +25 to skill

(Sensarity) yeah

(Sensarity) makes sense

(Kastra) 12.5% increase to ninjutsu damage

(Kastra) i vaguely recall damage feeling stronger then

(Kastra) but we also lost our relic head augments to feet, which means we coudnt use AF feet

(Kastra) so it kinda balanced

(Kastra) the head used to be +82 magic attack and +25% damage with merits

(Sensarity) that's insane
