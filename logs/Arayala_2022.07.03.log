[2]<Lostcrystal> so i defo need V1 or higher it seems

[2]<Terrorized> need the clear over v1 to use RP

[2]<Boondockz> just any v1

[2]<Aakor> hm must have changed at some point, i have a mule with it

[2]<Boondockz> clearing a v1 for the first time makes the moogle have a convo about upgrading items

Redwoods[Norg]: WTB * Mars/Venus orb 2.5M * Do you have it? Sell?

[2]<Boondockz> then i believe you can freely spend RP on any cleared boss

Redwoods[Norg]: WTB * Mars/Venus orb 2.5M * Do you have it? Sell?

[2]<Lostcrystal> i defo need to get atleast one V1+ clear, but i only ever see shouts for V15-20 and they just die to give RP

[2]<Goompa> like no shit

Cedbixler[Rabao]: Arebati V0 Do you need it? @ 5/6 Puppetmaster or Ranged Attack Can I have it?

[2]<Terrorized> yeah, anything not TC or ody is small now

[2]<Taskmaster> offpeak hours and no one is on
