Hyabusa[WestAdoulin]: Crawlers' Nest [S] ML/CP Aeolian Edge Party LFM Tank / COR @4

Ravynx(E) : Depends on how geared you are. Thf/Nin/Rdm/Blu are all pretty good for soloing in general

Vishysmith(E) : hello, i just purchased a Cid Sroll, how do i get Cid as a trust now?

Deathsduet(E) : Blu is generally good becuase of defence buffs high DPS output andself healing

Misakamikoto(E) : trade it to the Trust NPC found in starting nations

Felestra(E) : You need to do the quest to unlock trusts. Then you trade them to the NPC.

Hilarion(E) : is nin still ridiculously expensive? I remember it was expensive before chains of promothia but havent played since

Iiana(E) : NPCs sell ninjutsu tools of all kinds now, so it's relatively easy to maintain

Misakamikoto(E) : Some NIN scrolls are still expensive, gear-wise, not really, as for tools, depending on what you want to do

[2]<Libragang> not flexing, aren't verethagna better?

[2]<Kogara> oh there was stuff before that

[2]<Kogara> just seemed funny out of context

[2]<Libragang> oh ya i was asking what a good solo SC is for MNK

[2]<Twistedsoul> VS to VS

[2]<Libragang> i feel the best SC's vary sometimes depending on your weapon of choice, no?

[2]<Libragang> kk ty

[2]<Twistedsoul> it depends on ur weapon tho

[2]<Libragang> wow, that's just like thf. rudra's to rudra's

[2]<Libragang> godhands

[2]<Kogara> haven't tried to JP MNK in awhile. I recall having no idea what I was doing.

[2]<Libragang> np i'll play around with it some and figure it out

[2]<Twistedsoul> if u have godhands then make raidence

[2]<Kogara> godhands so you'd want to open with Shijin first, right?

[2]<Twistedsoul> with Shijin Spiral

[2]<Libragang> Shijin Spiral -> Victory Smite?

[2]<Kogara> Shijin > VS > VS

[2]<Libragang> kk tyvm!

[2]<Docfallujah> you should try to close with Shijin Spiral

[2]<Kogara> If think it's radience every time if you start out with a 2k TP Shijin

[2]<Taskmaster> maybe ill do MNK. spharai look fun

Original waves.
[2]<Twistedsoul> also depending on your gear, if ur just soloing like apex mobs or w.e sometimes its better to just use Howling Fist

[2]<Libragang> im using ken +1 (assuming that's better than malignance), godhands, two chirich+1 and two mache+1

[2]<Libragang> among other stuff

[2]<Libragang> im thinking of trying Sih Gates leeches

[2]<Libragang> someone recommended those earlier

Jhoo pokes Kimastar.
[2]<Twistedsoul> depending on your WS set u could prob almost 1 shot with Howling Fist then

[2]<Libragang> ah ><

[2]<Libragang> ive been going on TP sets since i returned back to game

[2]<Twistedsoul> well and what trust/buffs u have

[2]<Twistedsoul> and well if u just have a tp set then yeah Shijin Spiral VS VS is ur best bet then

[2]<Libragang> ok, thanks. appreciate all the input

[2]<Libragang> i need to stop procrastinating and set macros or use gs or whatever

[2]<Libragang> not macros sorry *gearsets

[2]<Libragang> can't believe i've been playing on and off since middle school that's so wild

[2]<Libragang> and im almost 32

[2]<Somera> id guess that is true for most ppl

[2]<Harugaru> sooo should i bother waiting to do Venus orbs or do i just do Mars as soon as i can get them

[2]<Leopeo> ive been playing for what a month or so i wish i had gotten into it when i was young
