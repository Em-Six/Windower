[2]<Brennski> Hey

Dremma[UpJeuno]: I was wondering how long a herpderp troll would take to come on here to cry about babies dying less

Sett[NSandOria]: Did I just see someone say that a womans womb isnt her body ._.?

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: That is not their body numb nuts. That's the baby's body

[2]<Solo> /wave

Drkzoul[Whitegate]: Odyssey C seg Farm Do you need it? TANK BRD Can I have it? /tell 4/6

Windygarden[WindWalls]: there is no baby. its maybe a fetus. often its just a blastillia

Arayala[Norg]: I'm so glad I can log into FFXI and keep up to date with the politics of the US!
Phillie[Rabao]: i found this clothes hanger here..

Uwansong[LowJeuno]: if abortion is murder i just did a holocaust in your mother's hair

Zoomzoombroom[WindWoods]: Truth is harsh - that pro-lifer's only care about that 'life' until it comes out... then no help at all.

Windygarden[WindWalls]: basically a cancer

Obanieth[WindWoods]: is there a linkpearl welcoming a new player or something? I have no idea what I'm doing beyond nation missions :D

Zoomzoombroom[WindWoods]: It's a moral high horse they ride upon to seem 'quite devout' and earn that seat in heaven next to the cheezus

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: Have you looked at a fetus on a surgical table? You know it moves right?

Drkzoul[Whitegate]: Odyssey C seg Farm Do you need it? BRD Can I have it? /tell 5/6

Fingerblast[WestAdoulin]: ~dont like to kill our unborn, we need them to grow up and fight the wars!

Sensarity[WestAdoulin]: a dead chicken moves if you cuts its head off, is that alive too?

Windygarden[WindWalls]: murder is murder. Your religios beliefs have no right to effect my laws. Abortion increasing outcomes for women. 

Uwansong[LowJeuno]: "it moves" is your requirement for something to have human rights?

Thewilltolive[Norg]: it's mostly liberals that want abortions, let them do it, less liberals, win/win

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: well, no, by that logic you should go abort yourself then

Shirokazesan[PortWind]: I thought I logged onto FFXI, and apparently I came into Twitter. Hate it when that happens.

Razuu[Mhaura]: time to start rapin' repubs

Uwansong[LowJeuno]: i wish i could abort myself, but it's a bit late

Dremma[LowJeuno]: It isn't fully grown is your criteria for it not being a human?

Windygarden[WindWalls]: no, its women that cannot afford to have thier lives ended suddenly. and over 1/2 are done by ppl with children.

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: why? I thought you were all advocating late term abortions, including ones out of the womb?

Dremma[LowJeuno]: you have fewer brain cells than pixles on a tarutaru nose

Curtle[LowJeuno]: I had a brain cell once

Spawnborne[LowJeuno]: Projection at its finest. You can stick to something you're good at. Like licking windows

Mighel[LowJeuno]: you are missed aborts

Razuu[Mhaura]: my dad-uncle and  mom-sister said abortions are the devil

[2]<Yossarianprime> heyo

Arayala[Norg]: Reading this chat makes me wish I was aborted

Zarloft[LowJeuno]: Venus Orb/Mars Orb Can I have it? Reward

Kumop[Rabao]: I love both games for different reasons 

Ronstadt[Mhaura]: Master Level Crawlers' Nest [S] Looking for members. COR WHM SCH RDM /tell @4/6

Baykin[PortJeuno]: in XI you had to earn your gear, and your gear laster more then a few months. I mean, Osode lasted like 8 years 

Dibs[EastAdoulin]: No, impact means that you're weak. So does slow, para, silence. etc... If you use any skills at all, you're weak!

Ninepointfive[PortJeuno]: someone is triggered by the lack of impact.  You should write a letter to your congressman.

Delorian[Mhaura]: they sorta occupy different niches I think.

Darkmessenger[PortBastok]: Agreed, FFXI offers a lot of lateral content, where FFXIV is mainly grind

Dynama[PortJeuno]: I have a question. Is there a better fudo set or am i missing something?

Ephemeral[EastAdoulin]: 14 = I wanna trophy every week!   11 = I earned my gear and have the deeps to prove it.

Spawnborne[SSandOria]: I was more hopeful of 1.0 mechanics. Then it was turned into a WoW clone. 2.0 was fine, but then it degraded

Cholesterol[SSandOria]: Osode wasnt ever a piece of gear for anything other than Chi Blast

Zoomzoombroom[Norg]: Rajas Ring can still be of use. o_o

Diluted[Rabao]: There is nothing to grind for in XIV lmao

Zarloft[LowJeuno]: Venus Orb/Mars Orb Can I have it? Reward

Brunht[LowJeuno]: FFXI has waifus for EACH expansion. XIV does not. 100% XI is a better game

Chharzilla[Rabao]: fudo is always missing something llol

Entark[Mhaura]: to be fair, a lot of people on this game just pay for things rather than earn it

Baykin[PortJeuno]: but XIV is ok since you can play it for a week or 2, and leave it, and play a few months later and re catch up.

Zazil[LowJeuno]: i play both, xi is more of a sandbox while xiv is more of a theme park

Runite[RuLudeGard]: Ya'll. XI and XIV are both great games. debate decided. they are games meant for different audiences

Darkmessenger[PortBastok]: I like that analogy.. @zazil

Brunht[Rabao]: XIV has odd-numbered patches with litearlly one days worth of content. Why bother

Cholesterol[SSandOria]: Ridill was the peice of gear with the longest shelf life in ffxi

Ronstadt[Mhaura]: Master Level Crawlers' Nest [S] Looking for members. COR WHM SCH RDM /tell @4/6

Khahara[PortJeuno]: wtf? you can PAY for whole ass 14 content clears thru the SE website, LOL

Ephemeral[EastAdoulin]: Chole, how does KClub compair then?

Diluted[Rabao]: You can pay for job boosts and MSQ progress yes

Brunht[Rabao]: Wouldn't D-Ring be the longest surviving piece?

Calvino[LowJeuno]: i think Suppanomimi has had the longest shelf life out of anything

Dibs[EastAdoulin]: or D's nuts

Cholesterol[SSandOria]: Kclub too i guess. was always pricey though

Mostlyawsm[PortJeuno]: ngl ffxiv is the perfect vacation MMO to my ffxi gaming

Zoomzoombroom[Norg]: Do a 66% Triple Attack THF build and KClub is boring :p

Khahara[PortJeuno]: imagine if you could just pay for mythic mission clears and a cat's eye? lolol

Pokiiassist[WindWoods]: and Evoker's Ring :D

Loganskywalker[Rabao]: i quit over loosing lot to ridill for 4 str8 tears fuck camping kings
