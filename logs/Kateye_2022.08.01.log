{Sylvie} Oh wow, good job, everyone! That Azi Dahaka guy in Escha - Zi'Tah is all beaten up. I think we won! Yay!
{Sylvie} Currently, we have taken down 9284 monsters in a row, which gives us a not-so-shabby total of 116903 monsters defeated.
{Sylvie} Okay, everyone! I just had the weirdest vision. In the next 10 minutes, somebody called ‡²Naga Raja‡³ will be showing up in Escha - Ru'Aun, somewhere around H-9! Is that good?
{Sylvie} There appears to be a unit separate from Naga Raja out there. Please head to Escha - Ru'Aun (H-9) and investigate.
