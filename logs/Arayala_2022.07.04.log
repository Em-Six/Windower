[2]<Lostcrystal> just because i cba checking right now, anyone kind enough to tell me what cap haste is with dual wield?

[2]<Teddyy> 12

[2]<Teddyy> 11*

[2]<Tropics> dont understand the question, but its a complicated subject

Pasismyhoe[PortJeuno]: Shield Spheres for cheap /check Bazaar (G-8)

[2]<Lostcrystal> lol ill just check haha, thanks anyway

[2]<Tropics> haste cap is not dependant on dual wield 

Pasismyhoe[PortJeuno]: Shield Spheres for cheap /check Bazaar (G-8)

[2]<Teddyy> at capped magic haste you need 11 dual wield to cap DW if thats what you mean

[2]<Tropics> its a static cap using gear, ja, and magic haste

[2]<Lostcrystal> its not but from what i read, dual wield makes attack faster too

[2]<Tropics> that answer is also incorrect

[2]<Tropics> 11 is the value you need if you have dual wield already from traits like subjob

[2]<Tropics> but for instance /dnc requires more than /nin

[2]<Teddyy> im presuming he has dw3

Lyss[WestAdoulin]: Capacity Points / Exemplar Points Do you need it? Looking for members. Please assist. 

[2]<Tropics> right, but 11 is not a catch-all answer

[2]<Tropics> its worth it to read the wiki on dual wield 

[2]<Lostcrystal> ah okay, so gear is 25% haste cap, i asked the question wrong

[2]<Lostcrystal> my bad

[2]<Tropics> i want to say the actual cap on gear is closer to 27

Lyss[WestAdoulin]: Capacity Points Do you need it? Looking for members. BRD COR or GEO Please assist.

[2]<Tropics> though i usually call 26 good enough

[2]<Lostcrystal> Equipment haste has its own cap of 25% (256/1024). - from wiki

Lyss[WestAdoulin]: Capacity Points / Exemplar Points Do you need it? Looking for members. GEO /BRD /COR 5/6

[2]<Thegata> w/ cornelia and h2 it is 11

[2]<Tropics> yeah its not 27 i just always go for 26 

[2]<Tropics> and knew it wasnt 25 or a round even number

[2]<Mishaela> i wish Cornelia would be perm lol

[2]<Thegata> ohh yeah

[2]<Brennski> Cause its down in bytes so its all 1024 maths

[2]<Gerbs> engage set 

[2]<Arayala> and what isn't working
[2]<Gerbs> engage set for cor

[2]<Gerbs> idle set works. but wont swap out when engaged

[2]<Arayala> are you going in melee range
Dracopatt[Norg]: Assault Mission Clear Mind book /tell

[2]<Arayala> If you're using Selindrile's, it doesn't swap to engaged until you're actually in melee range
[2]<Gerbs> yeah and attacking to test it

[2]<Arayala> Hmmm.

[2]<Gerbs> yeah

[2]<Arayala> When /nin, it uses the engaged.DW set
[2]<Gerbs> oh, that might be it the engage dw set

[2]<Arayala> Because obviously you'll use DW stuff in your engaged.DW set when /nin like Suppa, Reiki Yotai etc

[2]<Gerbs> can you shoot a Animikii Bullet?

[2]<Caradogg> once.

[2]<Gerbs> how do you get around not shooting it but getting the benefit when doing quick draw?

[2]<Kosumi> qd doesn't use the bullet

[2]<Godshatred> make a quickdraw macro

[2]<Fitch> quick draw doesnt use bullets

[2]<Caradogg> macro in a bullet swap for quick draw and end the macro with a bullet unequip

[2]<Gerbs> no way

[2]<Godshatred> just make sure you swap it out after the qd

[2]<Gerbs> do people shoot it a lot?

[2]<Caradogg> once.

[2]<Kosumi> Quick Draw is magic, it uses the heart of the cards!

[2]<Gerbs> Yogi!

[2]<Gerbs> er Yugi!

[2]<Caradogg> smarter than the average TCG anime!

[2]<Gerbs> oh right right QD usese cards

[2]<Kosumi> if you're lua is ok you'll never accidently shoot it

[2]<Caradogg> if you're running vanilla, you'll need to be a bit creative to avoid shooting it

[2]<Relisaa> so do you still have to farm the reive capes?

[2]<Relisaa> or can you just trade balyd for it

[2]<Gerbs> still have to farm them

[2]<Caradogg> farm, though the WKR events I think they drop quite often

[2]<Gerbs> turn 3 in for the one you want

[2]<Caradogg> and there's a 3:1 swap system

[2]<Gerbs> you can get them from colonization reives too

[2]<Gerbs> woah Hauksbok Bullet counts towards aeolian edge?

[2]<Caradogg> well, yes

[2]<Caradogg> or does it

[2]<Caradogg> I imagine you'd run into the same problem of "how do I not shoot it" :P

[2]<Gerbs> hope not

[2]<Gerbs> best range for Osash 8 or 16 yalms?

[2]<Gerbs> er, let me rephrase

[2]<Gerbs> best range for Osash 8 or 16 yalms to switch over to the Hachirin

[2]<Terrorized> 0.1 yalm

[2]<Terrorized> yes

[2]<Gerbs> lol
