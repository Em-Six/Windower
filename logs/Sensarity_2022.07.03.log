[1]<Darciee> sphinx whatcha upto?

[1]<Sphinxo> nothing bud

Altennnia[WestAdoulin]: anyone bored and wanna help me with a Wildskeeper Reive please ? ^^

[1]<Sphinxo> you fancy anything?

[1]<Darciee> eh well thats useless lmao i was hoping youd have something for me to do :p

Alienreptile[Rabao]: woowhat?

Mizukage[BastokMark]: the  council shall hear of this 

Alienreptile[Rabao]: she was on E

[1]<Darciee> ahh fair thats boring but important stuff :D @ me on disc when your all done bro ive got nothing imp to do 

Mizukage[PortBastok]: tis no excuse for this blasphemy

[1]<Darciee> so would just be to waste time kinda stuff

[1]<Sphinxo> nah its just pld lua

Alienreptile[Rabao]: was she wel payed?

[1]<Sphinxo> ive done the important ones and fixed my brd lua

Mizukage[PortBastok]: lashings! she will recieve lashings for this injust outburst

[1]<Darciee> ive gotta clean my bathroom at somepoint today -.-

[1]<Andromida> wont be any worse tomorrow :p

[1]<Sphinxo> get a cleaner dude

Alienreptile[Rabao]: thought they cus the niples off

[1]<Darciee> thought about it ngl lol

[1]<Sphinxo> chance would be a fine thing!

Sensarity is no longer quickened.
Jayqwellin[Rabao]: Oddy C Seg Farm Do you need it? Veteran Whm,Brd Can I have it? /tell 4/6

[1]<Andromida> oh wow I didn't know that xD

[1]<Andromida> apparently if your casting a spell and get Silenced and the Silence is removed before the spell would normally cast

[1]<Andromida> the spell will go of anyway

[1]<Darciee> since when? O.o;

Jayqwellin[Rabao]: Oddy C Seg Farm Do you need it? Veteran Brd Can I have it? /tell 5/6

[1]<Andromida> always

[1]<Andromida> so if you start casting a long spell

[1]<Andromida> you get silenced

[1]<Andromida> then whm Silenas you before you finish casting it not be interrupted

Godshatred[LowJeuno]: Incursion Chests Do you need it? /tell @3/6 BLU WHM Yes, please.

[1]<Andromida> the code only checks when you start casting and again when you finish casting the spell, not in the middle

[1]<Darciee> i wouldnt ever rely on that mechanic if thats the case 

[1]<Andromida> same with terror, petri and sleep

[1]<Andromida> no I wouldn't either, it is an edge case which is probably why they don't have extra checks in place

[1]<Andromida> considering the only spells that are likely to be affected by that are higher tier nukes its not that important

[1]<Darciee> yeah makes sense

Jayqwellin[Rabao]: Oddy C Seg Farm Do you need it? Veteran Brd Can I have it? /tell 5/6

[1]<Darciee> and even those under a FC set it be luck to catch

[1]<Darciee> bots would prolly catch it if weren mid casting a cure or something

[1]<Andromida> or if you had a really good healer who knows to start casting silence as soon as they see the TP move for example

Godshatred[LowJeuno]: Incursion Chests Do you need it? /tell @3/6 BLU WHM Yes, please.

[1]<Andromida> but you wouldn't have a healer that good looking after BLMs very often

[1]<Darciee> nah not even then on any active fight the whm isnt sat there idle

[1]<Darciee> they are always casting something so when silence hits they have to wait for arms to drop from current cast

Godshatred[LowJeuno]: Incursion Chests Do you need it? /tell @3/6 BLU WHM Yes, please.

Jayqwellin[Rabao]: Oddy C Seg Farm Do you need it? Veteran Brd Can I have it? /tell 5/6

[1]<Darciee> by that time only spell would be ancient magic that could potentially have cast time to make it viable

[1]<Andromida> yep

[1]<Andromida> also odd, Choral Roll/Bard Die is Spell Interruption Down but songs aren't affected by SIRD
