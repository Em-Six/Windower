[2]<Skilledretahd> i dont know anything about ody other than someone said you can solo the actual run through clear

[2]<Matopro> right

[2]<Taskmaster> yes, the RoE clears

[2]<Skilledretahd> and then the juicy nyame stuff needs bumba, who needs i think i counted about 12 or so NMs who have to be cleared

[2]<Smites> You can solo the clears for A,B,C. You can then either grind through all the tiers, or buy clears for the bosses. 

[2]<Smites> Kind of expensive though. Mercs charge like 20m per boss. 

[2]<Smites> Maybe worth it if you only want Nyame. 

[2]<Skilledretahd> i want better stuff in general

[2]<Skilledretahd> 20m per boss sounds like shit, i see them shouting bumba clears for 3.5m

[2]<Garthpsi> Those aren't clears, those are just RP farming.  No kill.

[2]<Garthpsi> If you want a kill, that's 20m territory.

[2]<Smites> Exactly. 

Kastra stares at the Earthly Concrescence...
[2]<Efx> dont pay 20m for a clear

[2]<Efx> such a rip off

[2]<Garthpsi> Ya.

[2]<Skilledretahd> fk that 

[2]<Smites> Definitely a rip off, but thats what they sell them for. 

[2]<Garthpsi> I MIGHT pay that for a V20 clear, but anything lower, no.

[2]<Efx> just ask and im sure you can find someone who can spare 3k segs

[2]<Efx> legit can solo/duo the v0s

[2]<Skilledretahd> is bumba like needs more than a group?

[2]<Skilledretahd> oh okay nice.
